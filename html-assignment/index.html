        <h2> About me</h2>
        <p>Hi my name is Maha kahil , I'm currently studying at algonquin college , the reason why i chose this program is that have always been fascinated by technology and creativity , I wanted to try a different program from what i've studied in my country .I believe in consistency that leads to success.I really enjoy learning how to create websites , even tough i found some difficulties</p>
        <p>In my free time when I'm outside of school , I enjoy spending time with my friends , listening to music and singing .Despite of being an introvert , I'm quite talkative with people who are close to me.I'm really into deep conversations and building relationships .Moving to canada and strating a fresh year has been both exciting and challeging.As a newcomer, I'm still adjusting and try to adapt to the new system and way of learning</p>
